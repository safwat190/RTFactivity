\title{Adjust transcription factor scores by propagating influence through multilevel targets with exponential decay}
\usage{
adjust_scores_multilevel_decay(
  gsea_res,
  geneset_GRN,
  max_depth = 3,
  decay_factor = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsea_res}{Named numeric vector of original TF scores (e.g., from GSEA).}

\item{geneset_GRN}{A named list where each element is a character vector of target genes regulated by a TF. The names of the list are TFs.}

\item{max_depth}{Integer. Maximum depth of target levels to propagate scores through. Default is 3.}

\item{decay_factor}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Decay factor applied exponentially by depth level to weight downstream TF contributions. Default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item original.score: original TF scores,
\item adjusted.score: TF scores adjusted by incorporating multilevel target influences weighted by decay.
