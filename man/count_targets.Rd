\title{Count number of targets per transcription factor and overlap with DEGs}
\usage{
count_targets(targets_list, deg_genes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{targets_list}{A named list where each element is a character vector of gene targets for a transcription factor (TF). The names of the list should be TF names.}

\item{deg_genes}{Optional character vector of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). If provided, the function will count how many targets of each TF are in this DEG list.}
}
\value{
A data frame with:
\itemize{
\item TF: the name of the transcription factor
\item n_targets: total number of targets for that TF
\item n_targets_in_DEGs (optional): number of targets that are also DEGs
The data frame is sorted in descending order by \code{n_targets_in_DEGs} if DEGs are provided, or by \code{n_targets} otherwise. Row numbers are reset.
