\title{Adjust TF scores and return direct, indirect, and combined scores as a data frame}
\usage{
adjust_scores_target_average(gsea_res, geneset_GRN, alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsea_res}{Named numeric vector of original TF scores (e.g., NES scores from GSEA).
The names should be TF names.}

\item{geneset_GRN}{Named list where each element contains a character vector of direct target genes for each TF.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the weight of the original TF score in the combined score.
- alpha = 1 means no adjustment (original scores only),
- alpha = 0 means score is fully replaced by mean target score.}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item TF: transcription factor names,
\item direct.alpha.1: original TF scores,
\item indirect.alpha.0: mean scores of direct target TFs,
\item combined.alpha.of.interest: weighted combination of original and target scores.
Row names are numeric sequential indices (1, 2, 3, ...) instead of TF names.
}
}
\description{
This function computes three versions of transcription factor (TF) scores:
\itemize{
\item Original TF scores (alpha = 1),
\item Mean scores of direct target TFs (alpha = 0),
\item Weighted combination of the two based on input alpha.
}
}
\details{
The resulting data frame includes TF names as a column, with row names set to simple sequential numbers.
