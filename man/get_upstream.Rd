\title{Recursively identify upstream transcription factors of a target gene from a gene regulatory network,
optionally restricting to targets among DEGs.}
\usage{
get_upstream(
  target_gene,
  geneset_GRN,
  max_depth = 2,
  visited = character(),
  exclude_self = FALSE,
  deg_genes = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_gene}{Character. The name of the gene for which upstream TFs are to be identified.}

\item{geneset_GRN}{Named list where each element is a character vector of target genes regulated by a TF.}

\item{max_depth}{Integer. Maximum recursion depth (levels of upstream regulation to explore). Default is 2.}

\item{visited}{Character vector. Keeps track of visited genes to avoid cycles. Default is empty (should not be set by user).}

\item{exclude_self}{Logical. Whether to exclude self-regulatory edges (TF regulates itself). Default is FALSE.}

\item{deg_genes}{Optional character vector of DEG gene names to restrict target genes considered. Default is NULL (no restriction).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item upstream_TFs: Character vector of TFs that regulate the target gene directly or indirectly (up to max_depth).
\item edges: Data frame with two columns \code{TF} and \code{Target} representing the regulatory edges leading to the target gene.
