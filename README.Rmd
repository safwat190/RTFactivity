# RTFactivity

**RTFactivity** is an R package to estimate the **Relative Transcription Factor (TF) Activity** between two biological conditions using gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). It computes both **direct** and **cascade (indirect)** effects of transcription factors, enabling discovery of key regulators that drive **cell state transitions**, such as those involved in wound healing, cell reprogramming, or regeneration.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Calculates **direct TF scores** based on immediate targets  
- Calculates **cascade TF scores** through second-order targets (targets-of-targets)  
- Compatible with any user-provided GRN (global or cell type–specific)  
- Accepts standard DE results (Seurat, DESeq2, edgeR, etc.)  
- Designed for applications in **regeneration**, **differentiation**, and **disease modeling**

## 📦 Installation

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("safwat190/RTFactivity")
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```r
library(RTFactivity)

# Load example data
data("example_degs")
data("example_grn")

# Run TF activity estimation
results <- compute_TF_activity(degs = example_degs, grn = example_grn)

# View results
head(results)

```
## 📂 Input Format
Your input should include:

    DEGs table (data frame):

        gene: gene symbol

        logFC: log fold-change between condition A vs B

        adj.pval: adjusted p-value

    Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) (data frame):

        TF: transcription factor name

        Target: gene regulated by TF

        (optional) score: edge weight or confidence
        
## 📈 Output
The function compute_TF_activity() returns a data frame with the following columns:

    TF: transcription factor name

    direct_score: effect from immediate (first-order) target DEGs

    cascade_score: effect from downstream (second-order) targets

    n_direct_targets: number of direct targets used

    n_cascade_targets: number of cascade targets used
    
## 🌍 Applications
RTFactivity was developed to identify TFs driving beneficial cell state transitions across:

    ✅ Wound healing (e.g., reprogramming fibroblasts to promote angiogenesis)

    ✅ Diabetic foot ulcers (healing vs non-healing)

    ✅ Beta cell differentiation

    ✅ Spinal cord regeneration
